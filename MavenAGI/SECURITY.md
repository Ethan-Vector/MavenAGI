# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, do not open a public issue.
Create a private report (or email the maintainer) including:
- What you found
- Repro steps
- Impact assessment

## Defaults (defense-in-depth)
- Tools are allowlisted and sandboxed
- No network calls by default
- File operations restricted to ./workspace
